"""
A naive Theano implementation of a stack whose elements are symbolic vector
values. This "fat stack" powers the "fat classifier" model, which supports
training and inference in all model configurations.

Of course, we sacrifice speed for this flexibility. Theano's symbolic
differentiation algorithm isn't friendly to this implementation, and
so it suffers from poor backpropagation runtime efficiency. It is also
relatively slow to compile.

E: Embedding Size
H: Output Size of Current Module

Style Guide:

1. Each __call__() or forward() should be documented with its
   input and output types/dimensions.
2. Every ChainList/Chain/Link needs to have assigned a __gpu and __mod.
3. Each __call__() or forward() should have `train` as a parameter,
   and Variables need to be set to Volatile=True during evaluation.
4. Each __call__() or forward() should have an accompanying `check_type_forward`
   called along the lines of:

   ```
   in_data = tuple([x.data for x in [input_1, input_2]])
   in_types = type_check.get_types(in_data, 'in_types', False)
   self.check_type_forward(in_types)
   ```

   This is mimicing the behavior seen in Chainer Functions.
5. Each __call__() or forward() should have a chainer.Variable as input.
   There may be slight exceptions to this rule, since at a times
   especially in this model a list is preferred, but try to stick to
   this as close as possible.

TODO:

- [x] Compute embeddings for initial sequences.
- [x] Convert embeddings into list of lists of Chainer Variables.
- [x] Loop over transitions, modifying buffer and stack as
      necessary using ``PseudoReduce''.
      NOTE: In this implementation, we pad the transitions
      with `-1` to indicate ``skip''.
- [x] Add projection layer to convert embeddings into proper
      dimensions for the TreeLSTM.
- [x] Use TreeLSTM reduce in place of PseudoReduce.
- [x] Debug NoneType that is coming out of gradient. You probably
      have to pad the sentences. SOLVED: The gradient was not
      being generated for the projection layer because of a
      redundant called to Variable().
- [x] Use the right C and H units for the TreeLSTM.
- [x] Enable evaluation. Currently crashing.
- [ ] Confirm that volatile is working correctly during eval time.
      Time the eval with and without volatile being set. Full eval
      takes about 2m to complete on AD Mac.

Other Tasks:

- [x] Run CBOW. 
- [ ] Enable "transition validation".
- [ ] Enable TreeGRU as alternative option to TreeLSTM.
- [ ] Add TrackingLSTM.
- [ ] Run RNN for comparison.

Questions:

- [ ] Is the Projection layer implemented correctly? Efficiently?
- [ ] Is the composition with TreeLSTM implemented correctly? Efficiently?
- [ ] What should the types of Transitions and Y labels be? np.int64?
