## Team member

**Nikita Nangia**: I’m a second year student at CDS. My background is in Physics, but working in R&D and signal processing got me to machine learning and data science. My long standing love for language and grammar then got me to NLP. Ever since taking Seminar in Semantics last year, I’ve been working with Samuel Bowman on various NLP projects and have completed two research papers (one published, one under submission). So clearly I’m really enjoying working in NLP! I definitely want to continue down this path. In fact, I’m be applying to PhD programs this fall to see if I can persuade someone into paying me room and board so I can just think about language and code all day.


## Reason for voluntary solitude

I’d like to work alone on this project since it builds on some prior work I’ve been involved in and the question being addressed is rather narrowly applicable to this work.


## Project choices

My first choice is the proposal in this repository called CapstonePropsal. It was written by Samuel Bowman since he would be my advisor on the project. In a nutshell: first I'd do a general literature review to gain a strong understanding of the possible pitfalls of  usingStraight-through Gumbel softmax for latent tree learning (I’ve already done most of this). Then, write a deep learning model in Pytroch that avoids said pitfalls, it will be less efficient, but it might be very effective we’d like to see what kinds of trees it learns. It would also be interesting to merge such a model with the ST-Gumbel Softmax idea to get speed gains.

Aside from that, I’m always interested in working on novel ideas for models that build sentence representations. I’d also be curious to investigate better evaluation techniques for models that build sentence representations.
